# PygLatin_Translator
This is a PygLatin translator that I developed using Python for my codecademy course :)
Pig Latin is a language game, where you move the first letter of the word to the end and add "ay." So "Python" becomes "ythonpay." To write a Pig Latin translator in Python, here are the steps we'll need to take:

Ask the user to input a word in English.
Make sure the user entered a valid word.
Convert the word from English to Pig Latin.
Display the translation result.
